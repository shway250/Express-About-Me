# Express-About-Me

## I want you to make an about me page using express and EJS.

# steps
1. fork and clone
2. npm install (I already have a package.json in there with some of your dependencies (THOUGH NOT ALL OF THEM!)
3. require and configure your dependencies
4. build a home route
5. put app.listen(3000) at the bottom of your index.js file
6. make a views directory
7. install and configure EJS
8. write your EJS files in your Views Folder.

I want you to make an object on the backend that includes:
1. a descript about you
2. an array of your favorite foods (or drinks or whatever).
3. a link to a image
4. any other stuff about yourself that you want to share.

You will then send that object to the front end using res.render()

You will then use EJS to render all of that content in your EJS file.
